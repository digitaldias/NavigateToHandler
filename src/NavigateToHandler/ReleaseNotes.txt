contributions by: Giorgi

v1.10
- (by Giorgi) If there are only two matches, navigate directly to the other one (not the one under the cursor)

v1.9
- (by Giorgi) Fixes an issue where not all symbols were found in some cases
- Removes private methods from the search results
- Adds Method Access to the search results (protected, internal, public)
- Removes the parentheses from the "as" column in the search results
- Adds (...) behind each method name in search results to better indicate that it is a method
- Updates nuget package references

v1.8
- Improves on generic types (probably not perfect yet, but the weekend is only so long)
- Slight performance improvements
- Slight visual improvement in the tool window (not dialog window as previously mentioned in v1.7)

v1.7
- Now shows multiple results in a dialog window, allowing you to choose which one to navigate to
This is a first iteration and will be improved in the future. Feedback is appreciated, either here or on GitHub.

v1.6
- Significantly improves on finding generic types. Does not work on covariant or contravariant types yet.

If your interface is declared as ICommand<out TInput, out TOutput>, which is coviariant, the extension will not work, 
but it will work if your cursor is over any types that implement it, like ICommand<string, int> or ICommand<Boat, Result<House>>.
