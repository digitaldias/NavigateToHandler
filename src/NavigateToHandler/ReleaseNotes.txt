Navigate to Handler
by: digitaldias

v1.7
- Now shows multiple results in a dialog window, allowing you to choose which one to navigate to
This is a first iteration and will be improved in the future. Feedback is appreciated, either here or on GitHub.

v1.6
- Significantly improves on finding generic types. Does not work on covariant or contravariant types yet.

If your interface is declared as ICommand<out TInput, out TOutput>, which is coviariant, the extension will not work, 
but it will work if your cursor is over any types that implement it, like ICommand<string, int> or ICommand<Boat, Result<House>>.
